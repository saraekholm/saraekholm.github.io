		<h2>Improved retention for dating app Relate</h2>

		<p>Client: Relate, a dating app for meaningful relationships launched in 2019</p>
		<p>Goal: To increase user retention by improving the matching experience in the app My role: UX designer & researcher</p>
		<p>My role: UX designer & researcher</p>

		<h3>How Relate works</h3>

		<p>Research shows that couples who share the same values are more likely to have long term and meaningful relationships. In Relate users are matched based on their values. </p>

		<img src="img/relate-1-how-relate-works.jpg">
		<p>Current flow of Relate: </p>
		<ol>
		<li>Choose eighteen values. Add pictures and write about them. </li>
		<li>See 5+ selected profiles based on your values at 19.00 every day. </li>
		<li>Press the “relate”-button on something you like to write a comment.</li>
		</ol>

		<h3>First round of usability testing & interviews</h3>



		<img src="img/relate-2-usability-test.jpg">
		<p>We interviewed six men and women who were tired of swiping and ready to settle down about dating. Then we asked them to download Relate and observed them during the onboarding.</p>

		<p>My role was to design and lead the research, which meant identifying what we wanted to know, create a screener for recruitment and write interview questions. We took turns in the team to be interviewer or note-taker.</p>

		<img src="img/relate-3-affinity-diagram.jpg">
		<span class="image-description">We gathered our insights in an affinity diagram.</span>

		<p>We found three major issues in the first round of interviews:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The users where overwhelmed by the onboarding process of choosing their values</li>
			<li>The browsing was difficult to navigate, which led to users declining all potential matches that day by mistake</li>
			<li>Most users hadn’t written or added any pictures to their profiles, which made it hard to find something to “relate” to</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>How might we make the profiles feel more personal?</h3>

		<p>Sharing the initial insights with our client, we decided to focus on making the profiles feel more personal, in hope it would lead to more meaningful matches, which would lead to increased user retention.</p>


		<h3>Prototyping & testing </h3>

		<p>In preparation for our follow-up interviews we created three quick prototypes.</p>

		<p>My role was to turn the ideas from the team into prototypes. I sketched and did several iterations through fast and informal tests. This way we quickly learned what worked and what didn’t.</p>

		<h3>Can we make the values more meaningful?</h3>

		<video controls playsinline muted src="img/relate-prototype.mov"></video>
		<span class="image-description">We built a prototype for picking values</span>

		<p>Having five out of eighteen values in common with a stranger doesn’t say anything about how well you will get along. Therefore we wanted to see what happened when we decreased number of values in a profile from eighteen to six. We also wanted to make the onboarding feel less overwhelming and offer more insight and reflection.</p>

		<img src="img/relate-5-prototype-values.jpg">
		<blockquote><p>“Wait! Are these my values? Can I take a picture of this? I need to reflect on this afterwards.”</p>

		<p>We found out:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>That 40 values (instead of 120 values) is a big enough pool to choose from</li>
			<li>Having to prioritise one value over the other forced the user to self reflection</li>
			<li>Getting a top six list felt really valuable (unlike the unsorted value tree of eighteen values)</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>What does the dream profile look like?</h3>

		
		<img src="img/relate-6-prototype-profile-2.jpg">
		<img src="img/relate-7-prototype-profile.jpg">


		<p>We wanted to find out what was missing in the profiles they were browsing. Which information did they want? And why?</p>

		<p>Our method was to let users create their own dream profile with pen, paper, scissors and glue. Current elements of the profiles together with some new elements were sketched on paper for the users to cut out. </p>

		<p>We found out:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>A lot of pictures ≠ being superficial. A lot of pictures indicates it’s a real and serious person.</li>
			<li>Pictures are a great source for flirting, it can show a person's interests or hobbies.</li>
			<li>Age is a “dealbreaker” and important to know straight away.</li>
			<li>The users like to know the other person's values, but don’t want to talk about them or discuss them. It feels too forced and unnatural.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>How can we help users to write about their values?</h3>

		<img src="img/relate-8-prototype-aid-2.jpg">

		<p>We tried different ways of aiding the users to add more information about their values. </p>

		<p>We found out:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Users find it really hard to write about their values no matter the aid.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Gathering insights from the second round of interviews</h3>

		<p>We realised the problem was bigger than the profiles not feeling personal enough, people were not acting personal enough. </p>


		<img src="img/relate-9-affinity-diagram.jpg">
		<span class="image-description">We made another affinity diagram, answering the question: Why doesn’t the profiles feel personal in Relate today? </span>

		
		<img src="img/relate-10-customer-journey.jpg">
		<span class="image-description">After meeting our six testers a second time and trying the prototypes on them, we gathered enough knowledge to put into a detailed customer journey map. </span>

		<h3>We narrowed down on one problem: The stressful browsing experience</h3>

		<p>The browsing was difficult to navigate, which made some new users decline all potential matches by mistake. The consequence was they didn’t have anything to do in Relate until the next day when they would be presented with five new profiles. It could take two to three days for a user to get their first match! This made some of our testers delete the app within the first week.</p>

		<blockquote><p>“I’m sorry I deleted the app!”</p><cite>- woman, 25, during follow-up interview after a week</cite></blockquote>		

		<p>The browsing had implications not only on how users perceive the app, it also had implications on how users acted towards other users in the app. As the browsing felt stressful, it encouraged an impersonal behaviour of just writing “hi” to not “lose” the match forever. </p>

		<blockquote><p>“I took the time to write something personal about me, and all I got was ‘hi.’ I’m so disappointed. I’m not going to answer her. Can I uninstall the app now?”</p><cite>- man, 33, during follow-up interview after a week</cite> </blockquote>

		<h3>An improved browsing experience</h3>

		<p>Browsing before:</p>

		<img src="img/relate-11-old-browsing-mobile-part-1.jpg" class="mobile-only">
		<img src="img/relate-11-old-browsing-mobile-part-2.jpg" class="mobile-only">
		<ol>
		<li>Users need to press “Relate”-button to get started.</li>
		<li>The dots on the top signifies that the user can swipe between profiles, but that is not possible. </li>
		<li>Profile image is too small. Users try to zoom in but it’s not possible. </li>
		<li>Age is not visible until after a match is made.</li>
		<li>Users believe the floating “delete”-button signifies to close the profile, but when pressed the profile disappears forever.</li>
		</ol>

		<p>Browsing after:</p>


		<img src="img/relate-12-new-browsing-desktop.jpg" class="desktop-only">
		<img src="img/relate-12-new-browsing-mobile-part-1.jpg" class="mobile-only">
		<img src="img/relate-12-new-browsing-mobile-part-2.jpg" class="mobile-only">
		<ol>
		<li>Users can see the profiles in a random sequence by pressing the image they would like to see. </li>
		<li>The dots in the top is removed. Instead users can flick between profiles by swiping down or pressing “close” and choose another profile to view. </li>
		<li>The profile image is larger.</li>
		<li>Age is visible.</li>
		<li>The “delete”-button has been changed to a “I’m not interested” button by the end of the profile. </li>
		</ol>

		<p>The improved flow was implemented in January 2020.</p>

		<h3>How to improve the service and business model</h3>

		<p>Zooming out from the usability issues there is a problem of how the service is designed. People who have the same values are more likely to have a meaningful relationship, then the service could be to only present profiles that Relate knows would be a good match. Perhaps it would be better to only get one or two profiles per month, but that they were really good matches according to an improved matching algorithm?</p>

		<p>The service today tries to bypass the period of flirting when forming a relationship, and tries to force a conversation about values before the relationship is ready. A better service would let the matching algorithm work in the background, and when the relationship is mature enough, the service could help them to start talking about their values. It could be reminders and different questions they could answer together. The next step would be to research: when is the earliest possible time for a newly formed couple to start talking about values?</p>
