		<span class="type">About me</span>
		<h2>From Fine Arts to Strategy to UX design</h2>
		<p>Growing up all I wanted was a pen and paper and I was entertained for hours. To study fine arts was a given.</p>

		<span class="image-description">Self portrait from 2007.</span>


		<p>Then I started  working as a strategist in advertising. It has given me experience in:</p>

		<ul>
			 <li>Understanding user needs</li>
			<li>Qualitative and quantitative research</li>
			<li>Presentation, workshop and facilitation skills</li>
			<li>Solving problems in creative teams</li>
			<li>Handling large and complex clients</li>
		</ul>

		<span class="image-description">I’ve improved the work conditions for nurse’s aids, got more young girls interested in tech, and increased awareness of skin cancer through play.</span>

		<p>Seven years and three advertising agencies later it was time for a change. I realised I was in the wrong role - and in the wrong industry. </p>

		<p>I’m a Design Lead student at Hyper Island in Stockholm since August 2019. During the same time I’m also studying for an online Professional Diploma in UX Design and a masterclass in Design Sprints.</p>

		<p>This has given me the capabilities to work with:</p>
		<ul>
		<li>Usability Tests</li>
		<li>Interviews</li>
		<li>Affinity Diagram</li>
		<li>Customer Journey </li>
		<li>Service Blueprint</li>
		<li>Design Sprint Facilitation</li>
		<li>Prototyping and Wireframing</li>
		<li>Structure and Navigation</li>
		<li>Interactions</li>
		</ul>

		<p>In my free time I do improv comedy. It’s theatre without a script where everything is made up on the spot! The principles of improv comedy can be directly transferred into team building and creativity. </p>

		<p>I practice, perform and occasionally teach improv comedy. My next shows are in 14 February 2020, you can find the tickets here. </p>
