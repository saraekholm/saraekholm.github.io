		<h2>From Fine Arts to Brand Strategy to UX design</h2>
		<p>I’m passionate about user experience because I love understanding user needs and solving problems. In short: I’m a problem solver. </p>
		<p>It all started when I worked as a brand strategist. My job was to understand the needs of all stakeholders and define the problem that needed to be solved. I was the one who made complex things structured and clear. </p>
		<p>But I was always drawn back to the feeling I had as a kid. Back then I was a creator.</p>
		<p>The desire to take a bigger part in the whole project, from defining the problems to forming the solutions, led me to Hyper Island. At the Design Lead program I have extended my toolbox to be able to turn insights into designs. I’m really excited to continue doing just that. </p>
