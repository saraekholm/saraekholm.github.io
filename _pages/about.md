<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>Things I love about being a planner: Ask questions, answer questions, present, pitch, win a pitch (or five), crunch numbers for a whole afternoon, ask myself what the most reasonable thing to do would be, throw away the numbers, design a workshop, hold a workshop, write a creative brief in less than 25 words, see the results of a successful rebranding, and watch a project I have worked on for months go live!</p>

<ul class="bullet-list"><li>4+ years integrated planning experience at industry leading and award-winning advertising agency</li>
	<li>ability to analyze a variety of information and pinpoint the problem to solve</li>
	<li>experienced in persuasively presenting recommendations with an outstanding pitch winning track record</li>
	<li>naturally curious and highly collaborative</li>
</ul>

<p>I currently work as a planner at Volontaire, Stockholm. Previously student of Digital Media at Hyper Island, Stockholm, between 2010-2012.</p>
<p>Before I got into advertising I studied art, spent a year living in Israel (where  my obsession of mint tea took off!), and worked as a manager at a Swedish equivalent to McDonaldâ€™s for a few months. On my free time I like to throw dinner parties, practice improvisational theater, edit Wikipedia articles, and catch up on the latest tv-series drama.</p>
