I analysed my own personal brand and came to the conclusion that a blog would be the best way to prove that:

1. I’m not lazy (I could say “I’m ambitious” here, but I actually think lazy pinpoints a current perception of planners that I want to refute)

2. I’m curious (probably the most important trait in a planner)

So, here we go! I hope you find this as fun and inspiring as I do!
